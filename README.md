# 2048-Game
The 2048 game in Python is a sliding tile puzzle where players merge numbered tiles to reach 2048.
 It is typically implemented using a grid-based system (4x4 matrix) and uses arrow key inputs to slide tiles in four directions. 
 Each move combines identical numbers, doubling their value. 
 The game ends when no moves are possible.

This game is created using JAVA.
